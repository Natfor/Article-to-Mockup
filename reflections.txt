Your response goes here!

* What new skills have you learned?
		So far I have learned a lot of HMTL5, CSS and JS. Perhaps I should clarify I have already done the next three projects to this one, doing this project now because of it being a new addition. However I did learn new elements which was great, this new sections it's a good addition.

	* What has been easy?
		I would say talking about all the things I've seen in the nanodegree so far, the easiest has been HTML.

	* What has been difficult?
		The hardest for me so far has been CSS, understanding how to make a good grid layout is very challenging, CSS is huge.

	* How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?
		I try to remind myself that even when sometimes some issues seem unsolvable they are not, I just need to give them more time, talk to other people and perhaps clear my head a little before I keep working on it.
